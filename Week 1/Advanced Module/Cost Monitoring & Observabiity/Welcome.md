# Introduction to Cost Management
In this section, we will walkthrough the foundational tools that need to be setup for efficient cost monitoring. We will showcase foundational topics like AWS Organizations, Cost Allocation Tags, Billing and various cost management tools. We will conclude the walkthrough with a recommendation tool for rightsizing, savings plans, and reserved instances.

# Cost Intelligence Dashboards
Do you know how much you’re spending per hour on AWS Lambda? How much you are saving with Reserved Instances and Savings Plan? Does your team know how much their application costs to run on AWS? Visualizing and understanding your cost and usage data is critical for a good cloud financial management and accountability.

Cloud Financial Management (CFM) is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud. CFM practitioners are pursuing business efficiency across all of their accounts by first visualizing their cost and usage, then setting goals, and finally driving accountability from their IT teams to meet or exceed these goals.

This lab will walk you through implementing a series of dashboards for all of your AWS accounts that will help you drive financial accountability, optimize cost, track usage goals, implement best-practices for governance, and achieve operational excellence.
