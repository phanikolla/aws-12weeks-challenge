# Prerequisites

If you want to view the images you upload to your S3 bucket and see versioning in action later in the lab, you will need a web host. This web host feature will allow you to interact with your S3 bucket in a real-world environment. Click on the template link button below to build the web host in EC2 using CloudFormation .

Download and launch the CloudFormation template

Download the "S3-General-ID-Lab.yaml" CloudFormation template by right-clicking on this link (S3-General-ID-Lab uploaded to the storage folder) and save it to your local hard drive.

In the AWS Console search for CloudFormation or select the Services menu and click on CloudFormation under "Management & Governance".
