# Introduction

This is an introduction workshop for AWS CloudFormation to get familiar with the service.

We will cover the basic on how to implement CloudFormation Service and build a template together.

# Please Read Before Starting:

This workshop is composed of 2 Labs; which are related to each other. It is recommended following the Labs in order.

Lab 1: Setting up a VPC covers the networking portion of the lab; where the EC2 Instance will reside

Lab 2: Setting up an EC2 instance covers the EC2 Instance hosting the website

Default region used in this workshop:
US-EAST-1

Template can be edited to use other AWS Regions; which will also force you to change the AMI ID.

I would recommend using US-EAST-1 until the dependencies in the template are fully understood.
